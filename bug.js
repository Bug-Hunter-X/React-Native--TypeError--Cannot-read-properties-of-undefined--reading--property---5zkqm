This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This commonly happens when fetching data asynchronously, and you try to render the data before it has fully loaded.  For instance, imagine fetching user data from an API.  If you try to access `user.name` before the API response has been processed, this error will occur because `user` is initially null or undefined.

```javascript
//Problematic Code
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUserData().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> //Error here if user is null
    </View>
  );
};
```
